Here’s a detailed guide on compiling and using **hping3** yourself natively on Windows with **MinGW** and **WinPcap (or Npcap)**, translated from German to English:

---

### **1. Prerequisites**

1. **Install MinGW**:
   - Download MinGW from [mingw.org](http://www.mingw.org/).
   - During installation, select the necessary tools, especially:
     - `gcc`
     - `g++`
     - `make`
   - Add the MinGW `bin` path (e.g., `C:\MinGW\bin`) to the system environment variable `PATH`.

2. **Install WinPcap or Npcap**:
   - WinPcap (older, often still used): [winpcap.org](https://www.winpcap.org/).
   - Alternatively: Npcap (modern and compatible): [Npcap Download](https://nmap.org/npcap/).
   - Ensure that the developer libraries are installed.

3. **Download hping3 Source Code**:
   - Obtain the source code for hping3 from its official repository: [hping.org](http://www.hping.org/download.php) (currently offline; you may need to use a mirror or archived version).
   - Extract the source code to a working directory, e.g., `C:\hping3`.

---

### **2. Set Up the Environment**

1. Open the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to the hping3 source directory:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\hping3
   ```

2. Verify MinGW installation by checking if GCC is accessible:
   ```cmd
   gcc --version
   ```

---

### **3. Prepare the Source Code**

1. **Modify Header Files**:
   - Open relevant source files (e.g., `hping3.c`) in a text editor.
   - Replace Linux-specific headers or functions with Windows-compatible alternatives:
     - Replace `unistd.h` with `<windows.h>` or implement appropriate replacements.

2. **Adjust the Makefile**:
   - Open the `Makefile` and update the compiler settings:
     - Change the compiler to MinGW’s GCC:
       ```makefile
       CC = gcc
       ```
     - Link the WinPcap libraries:
       ```makefile
       LIBS += -lwpcap -lpacket -lws2_32
       ```
   - Save the changes.

---

### **4. Compile**

1. Run the configuration script:
   ```bash
   ./configure
   ```
   If this step fails, skip it and manually adjust the `Makefile` as described above.

2. Start the build process:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. After successful compilation, the `hping3.exe` executable should appear in the working directory.

---

### **5. Test hping3**

1. Navigate to the directory containing `hping3.exe`.
2. Run hping3 with administrator privileges to enable raw socket operations:
   ```cmd
   hping3.exe -S -p 80 192.168.1.1
   ```
   - `-S`: Sends SYN packets.
   - `-p 80`: Targets port 80 (HTTP).
   - `192.168.1.1`: Example target IP address.

---

### **6. Troubleshooting**

- **Compilation Errors**:
  - Ensure all libraries are correctly linked.
  - Debug based on the compiler's output to address missing headers or functions.

- **WinPcap/Npcap Issues**:
  - If the libraries are not found, verify their installation paths and add them to the system environment variable `LIB`.

With this guide, you should be able to successfully compile and use **hping3** natively on Windows. If hping3’s official resources remain unavailable, you may need to explore alternative tools or archived versions.
